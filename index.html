Well if your reading this, omgg I can't believe you are actually reading it now, I wish I was there with u when your reading this. I need to tell you this message isn't written by ai it's written by me, and also read it privately alone okay pleasee.

Okay let me start,

I still remember I was scared how I am gonna take care of hadrian and still love u, when we were dating initially , I had a lot of doubts. But slowly I started to learn and became close to him too , ukw I will try to be his best friend instead of being his mom bf in the future too.

But the more I got to know about u, like how much struggles u had gone through and still u gave your best to make other happy that quality really made me feel good, because even I'm like that and you were so honest and pure.

Yes we might have a few difference here and there but still ik we can overcome that and love happily.

When I got laid off , I honestly thought ukw it's over, she's single mom why would she want to date a jobless guy atleast for the time being but u still continued to date me and trusted me and backed me.

That made me feel so confident and felt , ukw even I have someone to back me even when the worse of the worse things are happening towards me.

We went on multiple dates but the day I started to get feeling on you was during that date u and me went to the gym and ate Phillipines food and chilled together alone as one , I got a different feeling, I don't know how to explain. I felt safe, happy, loved and felt fun.

Idk my gut was telling me ukw this is it.

Ik we had a lot of issues from different people in the past who tried to manipulate me from not dating u ,I don't wanna pull up their names u know them already but still my gut told me , ukw ricky raquel is your women, please never let go off her and stay with her.

Ik the journey will be hard with hadrian, but I think I can make it happen and keep both of u happy.

Well idk when your reading this I have a job or no, but I'm trying to get my dream job so please be a little patient with me if I don't have one too.

I will back u until eternity haha.

About me going back to my country, honestly I don't know what's gonna happen on that but we can manage it.

Don't worry about your mum, your grandparents , your ex partner and other issues I'm here for u always okay.

I love you now, and forever until eternity.

Thank you for being such a wonderful human being in my life.

I promise you with my all heart , i will be your last date, last lover, last boyfriend and first husband.

Finally I can call Raquel as my babe, bae, boo and my everything.

Praise the lord.

Honey(u) and bee(me).

Love,
Ricky ❤️
