Well if your reading this, omgg I can't believe you are actually reading it now, I wish I was there with u when your reading this. I need to tell you this message isn't written by ai it's written by me, and also read it privately alone okay pleasee. Okay let me start, I still remember I was scared how I am gonna take care of hadrian and still love u, when we were dating initially , I had a lot of doubts. But slowly I started to learn and became close to him too , ukw I will try to be his best friend instead of being his mom bf in the future too. But the more I got to know about u, like how much struggles u had gone through and still u gave your best to make other happy that quality really made me feel good, because even I'm like that and you were so honest and pure. Yes we might have a few difference here and there but still ik we can overcome that and love happily. When I got laid off , I honestly thought ukw it's over, she's single mom why would she want to date a jobless guy atleast for the time being but u still continued to date me and trusted me and backed me. That made me feel so confident and felt , ukw even I have someone to back me even when the worse of the worse things are happening towards me.We went on multiple dates but the day I started to get feeling on you was during that date u and me went to the gym and ate Phillipines food and chilled together alone as one , I got a different feeling,  I don't know how to explain. I felt safe, happy, loved and felt fun. Idk my gut was telling me ukw this is it. Ik we had a lot of issues from different people in the past who tried to manipulate me from not dating u ,I don't wanna pull up their names u know them already but still my gut told me , ukw ricky raquel is your women, please never let go off her and stay with her. Ik the journey will be hard with hadrian, but I think I can make it happen and keep both of u happy. Well idk when your reading this I have a job or no, but I'm trying to get my dream job so please be a little patient with me if I don't have one too, ik I have the skills to get a great job and continue to back me now, I will back u until eternity haha. Well about me going back to my country, honestly I don't know what's gonna happen on that but we can manage it, many people have done it the past we can do it as well, that is if I went back to india. Don't worry about your mum, your grandparents , your ex partner and other issues I'm here for u always okay to help u out. I don't wanna talk more about this because I wanna show it to you through actions. I love you now, and forever until eternity. Thank you for being such a wonderful human being in my life, your the best and I love u vv much and will do anything for u. Also let me know when did u get this feeling like which day and which event , u felt ukw ricky is the one for me, i would be over joyed to know about it.And yes you are super hot and sexy and I love your looks okay so stop feeling insecure at times lol, I always wanted to be little naughty with u but idk you didn't get those feeling on me right so yeah that's why I abstained myself haha, but i would love to get little naughty with u after your my girlfriend. I wish I could be with u when your reading this, well idk where am I, well only God knows. I won't know even know whether u read this letter or no but if your reading it woww , I would be happy and and super excited to your boyfriend. I promise you with my all heart , i will be your last date, last lover, last boyfriend and first husband(I want this too in the future haha). I hope you will be my last date, last lover, last girlfriend and first wife(in the future haha). I'm super happy and please let me know that u read this letter I would be dancing over the moon I guess. Finally I can call Raquel as my babe, bae, boo and my everything, your mine and im yours.Praise the lord and always remember i love you no matter what happens to us and we will stick together as honey(u)and bee(me).
